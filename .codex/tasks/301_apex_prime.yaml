title: "Apex Prime (Soul) — Amanah Judge & Refusal-First v1"
context:
  goal: "Install refusal-first firewall and sealing guard that enforces floors, raises SABARPause, and writes zkPC receipt."
  artifacts:
    - docs/floors.yaml
    - docs/protocols.yaml
deliverables:
  - packages/apex-prime/__init__.py
  - packages/apex-prime/judge.py
  - tests/test_apex_prime.py
acceptance_criteria:
  - "judge(metrics) returns {'allowed': bool, 'reason': str} and blocks when any floor fails."
  - "seal_if_lawful() writes Cooling Ledger entry + returns seal_id when allowed; raises SABARPause when not."
  - "pytest -q passes; coverage ≥ 85%."
notes:
  - "Import SABARPause from platform.psi.psi_score; reuse platform.cooling_ledger.sdk.write_entry/seal."
  - "No network calls; deterministic behavior."
