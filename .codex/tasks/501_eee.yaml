title: "EEE-777 — Equilibrium Engine (Rate-limit · Phoenix-72) v1"
context:
  goal: "Stabilize the system: rate-limit risky drafts, provide SABAR orchestration, and implement Phoenix-72 audit hooks."
  artifacts:
    - docs/protocols.yaml
    - docs/floors.yaml
deliverables:
  - packages/eee-777/__init__.py
  - packages/eee-777/eee.py
  - tests/test_eee.py
acceptance_criteria:
  - "limiter(agent, metrics) returns 'allow'|'delay'|'block' using floors and recent ledger activity."
  - "sabar_orchestrate(draft, metrics) returns cooled draft or raises SABARPause if unfixable."
  - "phoenix_schedule() emits next audit timestamp (now + 72h) with ISO string."
  - "pytest -q passes; coverage ≥ 85%."
notes:
  - "Rate-limit heuristic: if Ψ fluctuates near threshold, suggest delay + ASI tune; if repeated fails, block."
  - "All pure-Python, deterministic."
