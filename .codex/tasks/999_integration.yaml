title: "Core-5 Integration — Mind·Heart·Soul·Compass·EEE v1"
context:
  goal: "Wire the five packages into a single flow: AGI draft → Compass route → ASI tune (if needed) → Apex judge+seal → EEE stabilizer."
  artifacts:
    - docs/floors.yaml
    - docs/protocols.yaml
deliverables:
  - packages/integration/__init__.py
  - packages/integration/runloop.py
  - tests/test_integration.py
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Happy path: truthful draft with Peace²≥1 routes to apex-prime and returns seal_id."
  - "Cooling path: draft with Peace²<1 is routed to arif-asi.tune() then passes judge()."
  - "Refusal path: Truth<floor or ΔS<0 triggers SABARPause and no seal_id."
  - "EEE limiter: when Ψ close to threshold repeatedly, runloop() returns 'delay' once then succeeds post-tune."
  - "pytest -q passes; coverage ≥ 85%."
notes:
  - "Use platform.psi.psi_score.Metrics + psi_from() + SABARPause."
  - "Write at least one ledger entry per successful runloop() and assert append-only."
